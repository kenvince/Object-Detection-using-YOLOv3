# Object-Detection-using-YOLOv3

#This Algorithm takes the video as input and extracts the keyframes with their respective time stamps from it.

#Using the YOLOv3 model , objects are detected in all the keyframes.

#Number of objects in each keyframe is counted and stored.

#At the end maximum number of objects detected in the video with its respective time stamp is given as output.
